    <H2>Situation</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      Anti-vaxxers are people that do not wish to vaccinate themselves for
      different reasons. Here is a document with my research and findings:{' '}

      . My own task is to give these people the chance to reconsider and think
      about this a bit more so that they can really make an informed decision
      rather than denying the possibility of vaccinating all together by either
      hearing rumours or depending on the opinion of non-professionals.
    </Paragraph>

    <H2>Task</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I have been tasked to iterate on my previous process and design and make a
      new poster. I must show a critical and analytical view on my work,
      describe the choices I have made and improve the quality.
    </Paragraph>

    <H2>Action</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I started by studying the research I have conducted and also the findings
      and the insights that I have come up with. During this time, I also looked
      up for some more research material and I found this article:{' '}
      <Anchor href="https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210129/anti-vaxxers-mounting-internet-campaigns-against-covid-19-shots">
        Anti-Vaxxers Wage Campaigns Against COVID-19 Shots
      </Anchor>
      . This article is myth busting theories and stating the facts. Theories
      like side effects that are causing to disturb the fertility quality,
      nanobots that could control us, altering genetics, they inject the virus
      in them by the vaccine, and others.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      “A majority of Americans express concern about the vaccines&apos; safety,
      a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll found: 68% say the long-term effects
      of the vaccines are unknown, 59% worry about serious side effects, 55%
      believe the vaccines are not as safe as they are said to be, 31% think
      they might get COVID-19 from the vaccine itself.”
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Having this additional information I thought of a different direction to
      take. I tried to look at it from the view that there is a lot of
      misinformation about everything online and offline. There has always been
      and always will be. But my goal could be to raise awareness about that and
      connect it with the Covid-19 vaccines anti-vaxxers as misinformation is
      the main cause of this phenomenon.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      My goal is to inform the anti-vaxxers that they receive the information
      refracted by their own prism. They believe what they want to believe. That
      they believe the first information they hear. That they are not well
      informed or narrow-minded. I went into thoughts about how I can convey
      this message. The first image that came to mind is the anti-vaxxer on the
      left with their hand in front of their face that is turned to the side,
      and on the right the scientist that has invented the vaccine explaining
      why the other person should consider getting it. The message is that the
      anti-vaxxers ignore and do not believe the scientists, the professionals,
      the science. But the scientist's job and the science is to progress
      forward and help humankind.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I also thought of creating a facet of a laboratory and stream a river from
      in where this river is made of positive things that have helped humanity I
      liked this idea but I wanted to create something more interesting and
      something that may convey the message better.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Then I thought of a game for children where they have a board with
      different shaped holes. A variation of that is that if you put the right
      object through the wrong hole, the object takes the shape of the hole. The
      vision of this is: you are given one information but you interpret it as
      you want, can, or are capable of.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>This is what it looks like visualised.</Paragraph>
    <Image src="/images/first_idea_cd.jpg" />
    <Paragraph>
      This is the idea that I wanted to stick with since it looked interesting
      to me. I also had conversations with family and friends about this
      imagery, what they think of, and the connection to anti-vaxxers. It is
      very promising. Now, I had to connect this idea with the COVID-19 vaccine
      and how this concept affects the view on the vaccine and its effects.
