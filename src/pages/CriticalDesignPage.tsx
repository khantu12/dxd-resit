    <H2>Situation</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      Anti-vaxxers are people that do not wish to vaccinate themselves for
      different reasons. Here is a document with my research and findings:{' '}
      <Anchor href="https://dxd-portfolio.herokuapp.com/critical-design">
        Critical Design Project
      </Anchor>
      . My own task is to give these people the chance to reconsider and think
      about this a bit more so that they can really make an informed decision
      rather than denying the possibility of vaccinating all together by either
      hearing rumours or depending on the opinion of non-professionals.
    </Paragraph>

    <H2>Task</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I have been tasked to iterate on my previous process and design and make a
      new poster. I must show a critical and analytical view on my work,
      describe the choices I have made and improve the quality.
    </Paragraph>

    <H2>Action</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I started by studying the research I have conducted and also the findings
      and the insights that I have come up with. During this time, I also looked
      up for some more research material and I found this article:{' '}
      <Anchor href="https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210129/anti-vaxxers-mounting-internet-campaigns-against-covid-19-shots">
        Anti-Vaxxers Wage Campaigns Against COVID-19 Shots
      </Anchor>
      . This article is myth busting theories and stating the facts. Theories
      like side effects that are causing to disturb the fertility quality,
      nanobots that could control us, altering genetics, they inject the virus
      in them by the vaccine, and others.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      “A majority of Americans express concern about the vaccines&apos; safety,
      a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll found: 68% say the long-term effects
      of the vaccines are unknown, 59% worry about serious side effects, 55%
      believe the vaccines are not as safe as they are said to be, 31% think
      they might get COVID-19 from the vaccine itself.”
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Having this additional information I thought of a different direction to
      take. I tried to look at it from the view that there is a lot of
      misinformation about everything online and offline. There has always been
      and always will be. But my goal could be to raise awareness about that and
      connect it with the Covid-19 vaccines anti-vaxxers as misinformation is
      the main cause of this phenomenon.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      My goal is to inform the anti-vaxxers that they receive the information
      refracted by their own prism. They believe what they want to believe. That
      they believe the first information they hear. That they are not well
      informed or narrow-minded. I went into thoughts about how I can convey
      this message. The first image that came to mind is the anti-vaxxer on the
      left with their hand in front of their face that is turned to the side,
      and on the right the scientist that has invented the vaccine explaining
      why the other person should consider getting it. The message is that the
      anti-vaxxers ignore and do not believe the scientists, the professionals,
      the science. But the scientist&apos;s job and the science is to progress
      forward and help humankind.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I also thought of creating a facet of a laboratory and stream a river from
      in where this river is made of positive things that have helped humanity I
      liked this idea but I wanted to create something more interesting and
      something that may convey the message better.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Then I thought of that game for children (Shape Sorter) where they have a
      board with different shaped holes. A variation of that is that if you put
      the right object through the wrong hole, the object takes the shape of the
      hole. The vision of this is: you are given one information but you
      interpret it as you want, can, or are capable of.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>This is what it looks like visualised.</Paragraph>
    <Image src="/images/cd/first_idea_cd.jpg" />
    <Paragraph>
      This is the idea that I wanted to stick with since it looked interesting
      to me. I also had conversations with family and friends about this
      imagery, what they think of, and the connection to anti-vaxxers. It is
      very promising. Now, I had to connect this idea with the COVID-19 vaccine
      and how this concept affects the view on the vaccine and its effects.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      With this basic idea in mind I have now started thinking about how I can
      connect this with the COVID-19 vaccine and anti-vaxxers. The first thought
      that came into mind was to have these this concept as follows: Have the
      syringe from the previous iteration and put inside cubes. When these cubes
      get pushed through, spheres will pop out.This idea sounded good at first
      but after some critical thinking I threw away this idea. It does not
      really make sense. The idea of the design won&apos;t be as clear as I
      would want it to.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Some other ideas came into mind like having the cap of an Covid-19 vaccine
      test tube have this kind of square “filter” and when the sphere goes
      through it becomes a cube as it shows the covid-19 vaccine through an
      anti-vaxxer view. Again, the idea was not clear.
    </Paragraph>
    <Image src="/images/cd/sketch_2.jpg" />
    <Paragraph>
      Then I thought of having the Covid-19 vaccine facts enter the
      anti-vaxxer&apos;s head through the filter: “I believe what I want to
      believe that has also been shaped by the opinion of other people and
      theorists. Going through this filter the facts become interpretation or
      something completely different. Then the anti-vaxxer spits out this
      altered interpretation of the effects in their covid-19 vaccine test tube.
    </Paragraph>
    <Image src="/images/cd/sketch_3.jpg" />
    <Paragraph>
      I really liked this idea. I shared it with family and friends to hear of
      their opinion by asking them various questions like:
    </Paragraph>
    <OrderedList>
      <li>What do you understand from this image?</li>
      <li>What do you think the message this image tries to send is?</li>
      <li>…</li>
    </OrderedList>
    <Paragraph>
      I got mixed answers. Some did not understand what was happening in the
      image at all. Others understood what the image is but not the message.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Then I created a prototype that I can interact with and better visualise
      how this idea would look like.
    </Paragraph>
    <Image src="/images/cd/prototype.jpg" />
    <Paragraph>
      Then I drew a more refined version of the image and tried to eliminate
      these issues.
    </Paragraph>
    <Image src="/images/cd/final_result_1.jpg" />
    <Paragraph>
      People now understood what was happening in the image a bit better. By
      some description from me they managed to also grasp what the idea and the
      meaning of this image is. I want to take out the oral description in order
      to understand the design. So I made a cleaner version and also drew some
      variations (with text on the person&apos;s forehead, and one with text
      around the sphere stating what it represents)
    </Paragraph>
    <div className="flex gap-1 my-6 flex-wrap md:flex-nowrap">
      <Image className="flex-1 my-0" src="/images/cd/final_result_half.jpg" />
      <Image
        className="flex-1 my-0"
        src="/images/cd/final_result_quarter.jpg"
      />
      <Image className="flex-1 my-0" src="/images/cd/final_result_full.jpg" />
    </div>
    <Paragraph>
      I personally like the second image the best but having these variations
      give me possibilities to test out what others think. Again, I reached out
      to family and friends to give their opinion for each of the versions on
      which they thought looked the most clear as a message. I also reached out
      to some friends that I have not shared any of this yet to collect some
      data from people that have absolutely no idea what this is about.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      All of them chose the 3rd option because the message is clear and almost
      everybody understood what the message is from the image. Though some of
      them thought that the ball is not going through the filter so this
      information is blocked which also contributes to the same idea. A nice
      coincidence I did not think of but it turned out great. I agree with the
      users and that is what I have chosen as my result.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      With this design I hope I do not offend any anti-vaxxers and try to show
      them that they ignore the facts or have false information about the
      COVID-19 vaccine.
    </Paragraph>

    <H2>Result</H2>
    <Image src="/images/cd/final_result_full.jpg" />
    <div className="flex gap-1 my-6 flex-wrap md:flex-nowrap">
      <Image className="flex-1 my-0" src="/images/cd/final_tshirt_mockup.png" />
      <Image
        className="flex-1 my-0"
        src="/images/cd/final_tshirt_mockup2.png"
      />
    </div>

    <H2>Reflection</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I think this iteration was successful. Compared to last iteration, with
      this one, I tried to dig deeper into the root of the problem. Trying to
      find out &quot;Where did the hear / read that the vaccine has such side
      effects?&quot;, &quot;What is actually the problem?&quot;. By asking
      myself these questions I think I found out what the problem is.
      Misinformation and ignorance of the facts. That is why I wanted to rase
      awareness that the anti-vaxxers are ignoring the facts or reshaping them
      so that they fit their understanding/view. But what shapes their
      understanding and view is the misinformation and personal theories.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      That led me to the idea of &quot;You believe what you want to
      believe&quot;. I liked it, it made sense to me, so that I why I went with
      that. I started to further develop this idea by trying to represent this
      with a design. First, a children toy called &quot;Shape Sorter&quot;.
      Then, a test tube that has the same idea. And finally, after some more
      developing, mental imaging and thinking, I thought of the anti-vaxxers
      filter of information and spitting out their representation of the
      vaccine.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The user testing also greatly helped me shape my final design better and
      also made me learn some stuff that I did not think of before. With this
      iteration I tried to get constant feedback on my progress from users so I
      can validate that I am going in the right direction and my design works.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      For the next iteration I will evaluate my current approach, research, and
      decisions. Based on that I might want to take in another direction that
      could maybe be &quot;Why do people post or trust misinformation?&quot; or
      &quot;What makes us not trust science?&quot;. These are question I would
      love to develop further.
