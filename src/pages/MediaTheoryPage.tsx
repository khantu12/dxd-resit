    <H2>Task</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I have been tasked to describe how my media manifesto fits in and has been
      used in all of my projects.
    </Paragraph>

    <H2>Action</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      First I reviewed my current design manifesto. I think it is outdated now
      since while I was working on my projects I have gettered more experience
      and I have a different view of the designs and the process. I wanted to
      update my manifesto to best suit my design views and experience. This is
      my new manifesto:
    </Paragraph>
    <Image src="/images/mt/design_manifesto_new.png" />
    <Paragraph>
      Now I am going to give detailed examples of how this design manifesto was
      applied within the different projects in the minor.

    <H3>Critical Design</H3>
    <Paragraph>
      In the Critical Design project I have started by researching about
      anti-vaxxers and asked myself a question: Why do these people refuse to
      vaccinate? From this main questions I came up with sub questions like:
      What is the cause? Is it because they are scared or selfish? It turned out
      they are both scared and selfish. After I gathered answers to my questions
      I pulled out findings and insights that guided my project. I felt like I
      had to focus on all of the issues. At first I thought that having a dog
      with a syringe through its mouth could be a good idea as the point was the
      same as my final design. But then I asked myself the question: Does this
      design transfer my idea to the users and most importantly does it make
      sense to me? It did not really make sense to me and also the users.
      Though, I love pets so I still wished to have some reference to them. I
      had some other ideas but I wanted to stick to my intuition. That is why I
      came up with the syringe filled with dogs and cats. Nevertheless, these
      pets are not there just for the sake of being there. They have a purpose.
      A pet is an animal that you are happy for and makes you happy. It can also
      make you relax and enjoy your free time. The whole message is that the
      vaccine can make us feel this way since if most / all of us get it, we can
      get back to normal life quicker and enjoy the stuff we enjoyed before
      Covid-19 that we can not enjoy now.

    <H3>Story Creation</H3>
    <Paragraph>
      When I was a kid I was interested in building / constructing stuff. My
      grandparents were buying me puzzles and things that I can build. My
      grandfather was crafting stuff all the time and I was always by his side,
      studying his movements and crafts because I was interested. Also, my
      father is an electrical engineer and he introduced me to computers on
      young age. Building and inventing are tightly integrated in my story.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I asked myself "What could my story be about? What are the motives of the
      main character? How does the main character progress through the story?
      What are their feelings?". From the beginning I knew that I wanted my
      story to be developing in the past. It was mainly expired by "The
      Imitation Game" and "Lost in space". I also wanted my story to be mainly
      sad, moody, and at the same time seem like that is hope to the whole
      thing.
