    <H2>Situation</H2>
    <Paragraph>This is my current design manifesto:</Paragraph>

    <H2>Task</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I have been tasked to describe how my media manifesto fits in and has been
      used in all of my projects.
    </Paragraph>

    <H2>Action</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      First I reviewed my current design manifesto. I think it is outdated now
      since while I was working on my projects I have gettered more experience
      and I have a different view of the designs and the process. I wanted to
      update my manifesto to best suit my design views and experience. This is
      my new manifesto:
    </Paragraph>
    <Image src="/images/mt/design_manifesto_new.png" />
    <Paragraph>
      Now I am going to give detailed examples of how this design manifesto was
      applied within the different projects in the minor.

    <H3>Critical Design</H3>
    <Paragraph>
      In the Critical Design project I have started by researching about
      anti-vaxxers and asked myself a question: Why do these people refuse to
      vaccinate? From this main questions I came up with sub questions like:
      What is the cause? Is it because they are scared or selfish? It turned out
      they are both scared and selfish. After I gathered answers to my questions
      I pulled out findings and insights that guided my project. I felt like I
      had to focus on all of the issues. At first I thought that having a dog
      with a syringe through its mouth could be a good idea as the point was the
      same as my final design. But then I asked myself the question: Does this
      design transfer my idea to the users and most importantly does it make
      sense to me? It did not really make sense to me and also the users.
      Though, I love pets so I still wished to have some reference to them. I
      had some other ideas but I wanted to stick to my intuition. That is why I
      came up with the syringe filled with dogs and cats. Nevertheless, these
      pets are not there just for the sake of being there. They have a purpose.
      A pet is an animal that you are happy for and makes you happy. It can also
      make you relax and enjoy your free time. The whole message is that the
      vaccine can make us feel this way since if most / all of us get it, we can
      get back to normal life quicker and enjoy the stuff we enjoyed before
      Covid-19 that we can not enjoy now.

    <H3>Story Creation</H3>
    <Paragraph>
      When I was a kid I was interested in building / constructing stuff. My
      grandparents were buying me puzzles and things that I can build. My
      grandfather was crafting stuff all the time and I was always by his side,
      studying his movements and crafts because I was interested. Also, my
      father is an electrical engineer and he introduced me to computers on
      young age. Building and inventing are tightly integrated in my story.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I asked myself "What could my story be about? What are the motives of the
      main character? How does the main character progress through the story?
      What are their feelings?". From the beginning I knew that I wanted my
      story to be developing in the past. It was mainly expired by "The
      Imitation Game" and "Lost in space". I also wanted my story to be mainly
      sad, moody, and at the same time seem like that is hope to the whole
      thing. I followed my intuition but I was constantly asking myself
      questions about the plots and motives of the story as I was writing it.

    <H3>Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment</H3>
    <Paragraph>
      In this project I started by studying the issue and finding the root of
      it. I think the best way to handle an issue is to uproot it. Finding the
      cause of issue and getting rid of it (or in this case raising awareness
      about it).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      During the whole process I was asking myself various questions: "How can I
      handle the bully?", "What message can I send?", "What would have the most
      impact?", "What idea could be interesting to develop or take in?". This
      helped me shape the poster I have created. Finally, we chose that one
      because it had the most impact when we were testing the posters with
      users.
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>Vega Collaboration Project</H3>
    <Paragraph>
      In this project I opposed my team with questions as much as I can. Because
      some decisions were almost to be made without any validation or second
      thought. In all of my work I like to think critically and take the best
      decisions. For example, when we had to make a decision about the story and
      the characters, my team was really excited about a certain idea but I came
      in with a constructive criticism opposition that made my team take a step
      back and reevaluate our decision. We tried to stick with our gut so that
      everybody is happy but we did not forget to ask ourselves questions and
      seek feedback. Iterate and improve.
    </Paragraph>

    <H3>Company Project - Additive Industries</H3>
    <Paragraph>
      For the Additive Industries project, in the first iteration of the design
      of the application I wanted to add distinction between the different
      industries. "What could this distinction be?" I asked myself. First I
      thought of adding icons for each industry which was a great idea but my
      intuition led me to choosing to identify the industries by color. When the
      industry is chosen we continue to indicate on the overview with the color
      of the industry. Now I asked myself "Is this a good solution? Is it a
      solution that would be intuitive or helpful for the user?". We have
      consulted with our mentor for the company project and they liked that the
      industries were color coded and they and the client suggested that icons
      could also be included to further aid the user.
