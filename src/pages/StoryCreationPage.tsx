    <H2>Situation</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I have written a story called: “A dream of a boy”. (next; Story Proposal)
      The story is about the life of a boy named Rik and his dream. Humble and
      quiet, bullied, and inspired by his mechanic dad, his dream is born. A
      machine friend. He starts to invent it, getting help from his dad. Goes in
      university where some bad news befalls him. Then and there he made a
      promise that he will carry out the machine friend project that he and his
      dad started. His PhD thesis researched ways to bring life to the machine.
      Rik finds a solution but it is only theoretical since computing power is
      weak at that time. Defending his PhD thesis he gets an excellent score.
      Rik wishes he gets a scholarship to help fund the realisation of his
      project. Nobody sees a use in his machine friend. Everything goes downhill
      for him from this point on. Rik started living a bitter life and passed
      away 10 years after. In 2030 a researcher finds Rick’s research and finds
      out that it is revolutionary. Rik has been included in the school books as
      the father of the algorithmic concept for the first conscious being.

    <H2>Task</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I have to write a second more interesting part after “The Fall”. Improve
      the drawing (iterate). Make it a more central piece in your work (maybe
      more of them to indicate the several parts of your story) and explain the
      meaning of your drawing.
    </Paragraph>

    <H2>Action</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I started by writing a description for the image I have created for the
      story and worked on improving/iterating on the image. This is the new
      image and the description:
    </Paragraph>
    <Image src="/images/sc/main_image.jpg" />
    <ImageCaption>
      This is Rik and his father, working on the robot in his father’s workshop.
      The robot is in the middle, father is on the left and Rik is on the right.
      In the workshop there are scattered previous projects of the father in the
      top left and bottom right corners. The room has a workstation, drawer, and
      a cabinet. There is a poster of a mechanical hand on the left and a
      chalkboard on the right where Rik has drawn him and his father celebrating
      with the built robot.
    </ImageCaption>
    <Paragraph>
      I thought of the composition of the image and I want to keep it the same.
      The image is a bit cleaner now and the details are a bit more refined.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      To write a more interesting second part of the story (after The Fall), I
      thought of some other motives and events that could contribute to the end.
      More specifically I thought of adding those after his attempt to get
      recognised in the inventions magazine.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I thought of adding a love story gone wrong to add a bit more impact on
      the progression of the main character. He falls in love with a girl that
      also likes Rik. At the beginning they do spend a lot of time together and
      have a great time.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Thinking about “love story gone wrong” I thought of some different
      scenarios.
    </Paragraph>
    <OrderedList>
      <li>
        (a) Despite that Rik falls in love, he continues pursuing his dream and
        spending as much time as he could on it. He fails to realise his dream
        and this causes him to get closed in, irritated, and angry. This causes
        them to argue all the time and she abandons him because of this.
      </li>
      <li>
        (b) Rik falls in love and his dream starts to fade away bit by bit. He
        realises that there is more to life than his dream. Gets married, has
        kids, and lives a humble life.
      </li>
    </OrderedList>
    <Paragraph>
      I asked questions like: What is the general idea of this love story gone
      wrong? Which option would be more interesting to develop? How could I
      write the story so that it connects seamlessly with the next chapter?
      Asking these questions helped me choose an option. I chose to go with
      option (a). After Rik gets abandoned by his girlfriend he crumbles even
      more. Then things get even worse. He starts drinking, getting into fights
      on the streets. Some time passes and he realises he has to do something
      with his life and continues living a humble life, working in a non-profit
      animal shelter until the end of his life. I called the chapter{' '}
      <b>"The Final Blow"</b>
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I also drew some more drawings. First row is the process and sketches I
      did think about the feeling and the composition I want to achieve. Second
      row are the 2 finished drawings, they are for “The Step” and for “The
      Fall” respectively.
    </Paragraph>

    <ImageCaption>
      In the first image, Rik, during his second year in university, finds out
      that his father has passed away by the letter on the floor and is crying
      on the bed. We have the robot in the foreground to also give a hint of
      Rik’s dream and it will be affected by this event. In the second image,
      Rik is defending his PhD. He is explaining how his algorithm works, how it
      interacts with the robot, and writing mathematical equations. He has also
      brought the robot on the stage to give more impact by showing something
      physical, something that the jury can touch and feel.

    <H2>Reflection</H2>
    <Paragraph>
      I started with fixing my main image, making it cleaner and adding a
      description and I like how it turned out. Though I think the image itself
      could be a bit cleaner and maybe have a better perspective.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The next chapter that I wrote called “The Final Blow” also could be
      extended or could be split into multiple chapters since the actions there
      go through quickly. I tried to think of some other interesting motives and
      turnarounds that could add more spice to the story. I added a love story
      that went wrong. We see a little glimpse of happiness and hope. But that
      is soon diminished. I feel like this is an interesting turnaround.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I am also pleased with the other images I have made. I do not think there
      is anything I would like to change about them. Also, I could have created
      a bit more images if the time allowed.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      With the next iteration I could split up theFor the next iterations I
      could split up “The Final Blow” chapter into more chapters. One could be
      about the love life of Rik, the next could be about his efforts to achieve
      his dream, and the final one could be his life while he indulges in
      alcohol and tries to deal with the pain. I can also draw more images, one
      for each of the chapters.
